# Running a local instance

## Pre-requisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

- [s2i](https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image/releases)

- [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq)

- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com)

`jq` and `ngrok` are available on package manager systems for different platforms such as [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (Mac), [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) (Windows) and various Linux distribution package managers.

## Install the service

Open the terminal and run the below command:

    $ curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hyperledgerkochi/KOB-email-verification/dist/dist/get.kob_email_verification_service.io | bash

## Running

Open two shell/terminal sessions:

1. From within the [scripts](./scripts) folder execute `./start-ngrok.sh`. This will create a tunnel for the agent.

2. From within the [docker](./docker) folder:
    - run `./manage build` to assemble the runtime images for the services
    - when the build completes, run `./manage up`

_Refer to `manage -h` for additional usage information._

Once services are started, visit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to see the app running and visit [http://localhost:8050](http://localhost:8050) to see any outbound mail the app is sending (it won't actually send any email message in the development environment).

## Stopping

To stop the service:

1.  Open a new terminal

2.  From within the [docker](./docker) folder:
    -  run `./manage down`
