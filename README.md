User      submit this digital credential, when he provides his email for availing third party service, or the user authorize any third party to prove the identity of the user. 
   
 ## Dependant Project

 ## Motivation
   Current email security solutions depend on various attributes to reduce the chances that a given email (mail) is likely to be a threat.This is a decentralized, peer-to-peer,    proof-of-work, encrypted mail system that uses blockchain technology to conduct email verification. Decentralized Identifier or DIDs refer to a system in which there is no      common storage facility available. There might be many users who cannot setup and maintain DIDs themselves.

## Status Of The Project
   Incubation
   
## Solution
   To overcome this problem a blockchain based ledger service marks down an outgoing mail. Using this approach email details (e.g., sender, recipients, timestamp, etc.) are        hashed and saved from any organization using email security gateways. Any organization receiving the mail can check it for authenticity via the blockchain service, thus the      mail cannot be spam. This application can generate a lot of interest especially since spam mail has continued to circulate online, with some strategies linking the email to      seemingly credible sources.
